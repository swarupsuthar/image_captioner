# Image_Captioner
#### Image captioning model uses Bi-Directional LSTM along with CNN for building semantic relation between caption and image features with Luong attention. The alignment weights are further multiplied with hidden states of caption and concatenated with image hidden sate for consecutive word predictions using softmax activation.The model has been trained the Flicker8k dataset. It leverages VGG16 for feature extraction.
